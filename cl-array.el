;;; Commentary:

;; This package is designed as an API for multi-dimensional arrays.  It
;; strives to conform to the Common Lisp specification for
;; multi-dimensional arrays.  The limitations of this package are a
;; direct result of the limitations of Emacs Lisp.

;; Some things to note.  If you're going to use this package, to port
;; real CL code to (X)Emacs, then you must replace the following function
;; calls:

;; aref          ==>     aref*
;; arrayp        ==>     arrayp*

;; This last one is the most crucial since, if you don't, the code
;; will not err when it should, since I'm using elisp `vectors' to
;; store the array structures.  This being done, the code should work
;; (with respect to arrays), provided that they're not using
;; fill-pointers, displacement, etc.

;;  Here are some examples of how it's used...

;; (setq 3D-array (make-array '(5 8 10) :initial-element 0))
;; (arrayp* 3D-array)
;; ==> t
;; (vectorp* 3D-array)
;; ==> nil
;; (array-in-bounds-p 3D-array 1 1 1)
;; ==> t
;; (array-in-bounds-p 3D-array 20 20 20)
;; ==> nil
;; (aref* 3D-array 2 4 6)
;; ==> 0
;; (aref* 3D-array 2 4 6)
;; ==> 10
;; (setf (aref* 3D-array 10 20 30) 5)
;; ==> ERROR
;; (setf (aref* 3D-array 2 4 6) 5)
;; ==> 5
;; (loop for i below (array-total-size 3D-array)
;;   do
;;   (setf (row-major-aref 3D-array i) (* i i)))
;; (row-major-aref 3D-array 12)
;; ==> 144
;; (array-rank 3D-array)
;; ==> 3
;; (array-dimension 3D-array 2)
;; ==> 8
;; (array-total-size 3D-array)
;; ==> 400
